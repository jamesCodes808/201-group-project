### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

    James

    Chris

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

    We will have open communication through slack and organized meetup times to check up on tasks and assign new tasks as they are done. 

## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

    Making and taking meaningful notes of progress and tasks that are done, or need to be done so other teammates can understand what is going on. Teammates will keep an open communication line if problems arise. If it gets to a point where it cannot be resolved, we will consult higher ups (TA or Teacher).

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

    We can rely on communication to make sure it doesn't happen. We are also assigning roles and creating a task board, so we can see who is doing what using Trello.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

    By doing quick daily standups on weekdays, lasting at least 5-10 minutes. Set aside a time to troubleshoot code as a group when problems arise. And assist other teammates if time permits. 

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

    If a teammate is not adequately contributing during group troubleshooting and standups we can ask why a person was not able to complete a tasks, and if it becomes a problem consult higher ups. And keep an open line of communication to see if a teammate is not able to contribute, if not we can assist in completing tasks. 

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

    To higher ups if conflicts get worse when trying to resolve within team. 


## Communication Plan

### What hours will you be available to communicate?

    James:
    - Sun-Sat: 9am-9pm (unless something arises or appointments) (also, has daughter in middle school that needs to be picked up and dropped off)

    Chris:
    - All times (With discretion because has teaching job on side, No guarantees on instant replies)

    Ernesto:
    - 

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

    Slack for communication, Remo for group meet ups, Trello for task board

### How often will you take breaks?

    We will communicate when we need time off. But we will work towards the deadlines at our own pace. Taking usual breaks such as lunch and dinners and quality time with fam.

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

    What does this mean? There is no try only do.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?\

    Through Slack

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

    Open communication through daily meetups and regular check-ins. Make sure everyone has some time on the mic.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

    Ensure that we have an inclusive environment with open communication. If a teammate does not feel comfortable speaking up, we will address the reasons why and resolve the reason together. Also be mindful of others.

## Work Plan

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

    We are going to be using a [trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/wRd2YPAI/ATTI79e8c73d251387ed87a3d2c1e57fa292ADF32FEF/code-201-project) board.
